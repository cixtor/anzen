	// Capacity is the size for the Cuckoo Filter in bytes. A capacity of
	// 1,000,000 bytes is a normal default, which allocates about ~1MB on
	// 64-bit machines.
	Capacity uint

	// Storage is the filename with a copy of the Cuckoo Filter. The web
	// service frequently exports the database to this file to maintain the
	// integrity of the database, for example, every time a new malicious URL
	// is added to the blacklist and during the graceful server shutdown. The
	// database is loaded into memory when the server is restarted.
	Storage string

	// Hostname is the domain associated to the web service. The hostname is
	// also used to construct the URL for the server pool hosting the malware
	// database. For example, if the hostname is example.test then the server
	// pool will look like this: threat-info-PREFIX.example.test
	Hostname string

	// AuthSecret is the shared secret key to communicate with other servers.
	AuthSecret string

	// ServerPrefixN is the number of characters from the URL-hash that will
	// help create the server prefix for the additional web service that we
	// are going to communicate with. The bigger the number
	// the bigger the pool of servers we expect to communicate with.
	//
	// If the length is set to one the size of the server pool will be sixteen,
	// one server for each hexadecimal character [0-9] + [a-f]. If the length
	// is two then the size of the server pool will be 256, one for every
	// combination like so: 00, 01, 02, ... 0a, 0b, 0c and so on until [ff].
	//
	// The maximum size would then be sixty-four which is the size of hashed
	// data using SHA256. Because zero-zero is a valid prefix for a SHA256 sum
	// it means we have to consider repetitions in the calculation of the
	// permutations. So theoretically speaking, the size of the server pool
	// would be equal to:
	//
	//   115,792,089,237,316,...
	//   195,423,570,985,008,...
	//   687,907,853,269,984,...
	//   665,640,564,039,457,...
	//   584,000,000,000,000,000
	//
	// PS: I donâ€™t even know how to read that number :thinking_face:
